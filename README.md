Arduino Library Management System
====

This repository is a part of [codebender](https://codebender.cc), an Arduino development plaftorm for hardware enthousiasts, artists and makers.

#### What's that?

It is the library management system used on the backend of codebender, which takes care of all the libraries needed. It supports Arduino built-in libraries and examples as well as external libraries.

#### And how does it work?

This system is designed to act as a RESTful service for fetching library source code, and library examples. The API calls provided are described on the project's wiki pages. It also operates as a website for searching external libraries, viewing libraries' source code and information, and adding new libraries to the system.
